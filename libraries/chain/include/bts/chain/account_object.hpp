    *  minimize the amount of data that must be backed up as part of the undo
    *  history everytime a transfer is made.

    *  16KB in the undo buffer... this could significantly degrade performance
    *  at a large scale.  A future optimization would be to have a balance
    *  object for each asset type or at the very least group assets into
    *  smaller numbers.
