   /**
    *  All transactions are sets of operations that must be
    *  applied atomically.  Transactions must refer to a recent
    *  block that defines the context of the operation so that
    *  they assert a known binding to the object id's referenced
    *  in the transaction.
    *
    *  Rather than specify a full block number, we only specify
    *  the lower 16 bits of the block number which means you can
    *  reference any block within the last 65,536 blocks which
    *  is 3.5 days with a 5 second block interval or 18 hours
    *  with a 1 second interval.
    *
    *  All transactions must expire so that the network does
    *  not have to maintain a permanent record of all transactions
    *  ever published.  Because the network processes transactions
    *  rapidly there is no need to have an expiration time more
    *  than 1 round in the future.  If there are 101 delegates and
    *  a 5 second interval that means 8 minutes.  We can therefore
    *  specify an expiration time as the number of block intervals
    *  since the reference block's time.
    *
    *  Note: The number of block intervals is different than
    *  the number of blocks.  In effect the maximum period that
    *  a transaction is theoretically valid is 18 hours (1 sec interval) to
    *  3.5 days (5 sec interval) if the reference block was
    *  the most recent block.
    *
    *  The block prefix is the first 4 bytes of the block hash of
    *  the reference block number.
    *
    *  Note: A transaction cannot be migrated between forks outside
    *  the period of ref_block_num.time to (ref_block_num.time + rel_exp * interval).
    *  This fact can be used to protect market orders which should specify
    *  a relatively short re-org window of perhaps less than 1 minute.  Normal
    *  payments should probably have a longer re-org window to ensure
    *  their transaction can still go through in the event of a
    *  momentary disruption in service.
