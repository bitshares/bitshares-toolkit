    *  Delegate votes are updated all the time which means that an "undo" state
    *  must be generated for every delegate.  Undo states require serializing 
    *  and saving a copy of a complete object.  delegate_object is easily 250 bytes
    *  and there are potentially 220 delegates that require updating with
    *  every transaction.  This would generate 53KB of serialized backup state
    *  per processed transaction.  
    *
    *  To get around this delegate votes are moved into their own object type that
    *  has less than 32 bytes of backup state or at most 7 KB.  The penalty is
    *  a double-lookup of the object on every vote...
