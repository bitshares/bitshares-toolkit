    * @brief This operation is used to whitelist and blacklist accounts, primarily for transacting in whitelisted assets
    *
    * Accounts can freely specify opinions about other accounts, in the form of either whitelisting or blacklisting
    * them. This information is used in chain validation only to determine whether an account is authorized to transact
    * in an asset type which enforces a whitelist, but third parties can use this information for other uses as well,
    * as long as it does not conflict with the use of whitelisted assets.
    *
    * An asset which enforces a whitelist specifies a list of accounts to maintain its whitelist, and a list of
    * accounts to maintain its blacklist. In order for a given account A to hold and transact in a whitelisted asset S,
    * A must be whitelisted by at least one of S's whitelist_authorities and blacklisted by none of S's
    * blacklist_authorities. If A receives a balance of S, and is later removed from the whitelist(s) which allowed it
    * to hold S, or added to any blacklist S specifies as authoritative, A's balance of S will be frozen until A's
    * authorization is reinstated.
    *
    * This operation requires authorizing_account's signature, but not account_to_list's. The fee is paid by
    * authorizing_account.

   /**
     * The Graphene Transaction Proposal Protocol
     *
     * Graphene allows users to propose a transaction which requires approval of multiple accounts in order to execute.
     * The user proposes a transaction using proposal_create_operation, then signatory accounts use
     * proposal_update_operations to add or remove their approvals from this operation. When a sufficient number of
     * approvals have been granted, the operations in the proposal are used to create a virtual transaction which is
     * subsequently evaluated. Even if the transaction fails, the proposal will be kept until the expiration time, at
     * which point, if sufficient approval is granted, the transaction will be evaluated a final time. This allows
     * transactions which will not execute successfully until a given time to still be executed through the proposal
     * mechanism. The first time the proposed transaction succeeds, the proposal will be regarded as resolved, and all
     * future updates will be invalid.
     *
     * The proposal system allows for arbitrarily complex or recursively nested authorities. If a recursive authority
     * (i.e. an authority which requires approval of 'nested' authorities on other accounts) is required for a
     * proposal, then a second proposal can be used to grant the nested authority's approval. That is, a second
     * proposal can be created which, when sufficiently approved, adds the approval of a nested authority to the first
     * proposal. This multiple-proposal scheme can be used to acquire approval for an arbitrarily deep authority tree.
     *
     * Note that at any time, a proposal can be approved in a single transaction if sufficient signatures are available
     * on the proposal_update_operation, as long as the authority tree to approve the proposal does not exceed the
     * maximum recursion depth. In practice, however, it is easier to use proposals to acquire all approvals, as this
     * leverages on-chain notification of all relevant parties that their approval is required. Off-chain
     * multi-signature approval requires some off-chain mechanism for acquiring several signatures on a single
     * transaction. This off-chain syncrhonization can be avoided using proposals.
