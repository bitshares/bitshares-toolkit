   /**
     * @defgroup worker_types Implementations of the various worker types in the system
     *
     * The system has various worker types, which do different things with the money they are paid. These worker types
     * and their semantics are specified here.
     *
     * All worker types exist as a struct containing the data this worker needs to evaluate, as well as a method
     * pay_worker, which takes a pay amount and a non-const database reference, and applies the worker's specific pay
     * semantics to the worker_type struct and/or the database. Furthermore, all worker types have an initializer,
     * which is a struct containing the data needed to create that kind of worker.
     *
     * Each initializer type has a method, init, which takes a non-const database reference, a const reference to the
     * worker object being created, and a non-const reference to the specific *_worker_type object to initialize. The
     * init method creates any further objects, and initializes the worker_type object as necessary according to the
     * semantics of that particular worker type.
     *
     * To create a new worker type, define a my_new_worker_type struct with a pay_worker method which updates the
     * my_new_worker_type object and/or the database. Create a my_new_worker_type::initializer struct with an init
     * method and any data members necessary to create a new worker of this type. Reflect my_new_worker_type and
     * my_new_worker_type::initializer into FC's type system, and add them to @ref worker_type and @ref
     * worker_initializer respectively. Make sure the order of types in @ref worker_type and @ref worker_initializer
     * remains the same.
