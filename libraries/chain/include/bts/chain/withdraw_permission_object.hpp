   * @class withdraw_permission_object
   * @brief Grants another account authority to withdraw a limited amount of funds per interval
   *
   * The primary purpose of this object is to enable recurring payments on the blockchain. An account which wishes to
   * process a recurring payment may use a @ref withdraw_permission_claim_operation to reference an object of this type
   * and withdraw up to @ref withdrawal_limit from @ref withdraw_from_account. Only @ref authorized_account may do this,
   * and it may only be done once per withdrawal period (as defined by @ref withdrawal_period_sec), even if the first
   * withdrawal in the period was less than the limit.
