    *  @class create_account_operation
    *  @brief Creates a new account 
    *
    *  An account is a named pair authorities (permissions) that are assigned a name.   An
    *  authority is simply a N-of-M multi-signature specification. 
    *
    *  These authorities are separated into two categories: owner and active.  The *owner*
    *  authority is designed to be kept in "cold-storage" and is not required for day-to-day
    *  operations.   The *active* authority maintains spending control over the account. The
    *  *owner* may change the *active* authority at any time. 
    *
    *  Accounts are transferrable if signed by the owner and a new registration_fee is paid. 
    *  You "transfer" an account by "re-registering it".   
    *
    *  Names may only contain [a-z0-9] or '-' and must start with [a-z] and not have more
    *  than one '-' in a row.   A name can have up to 63 characters.  
    *
    *  Sub-accounts can be created by specifying a "/", ie: root/child/grandchild.   The root account active
    *  key has signing authority over all children.  The full name "root/child/grandchild" is part of
    *  the 63 character limit
    *
    *  The registration_fee depends upon the number of characters in the name and the
    *  current median registration_fee published by the delegates.  Names with more than
    *  8 characters or that include a number are free.  The registration fee can be
    *  calculated as follows registration_fee*10^(8-NUM_CHARACTERS). There is no registration 
    *  fee for child accounts.

    *  @class create_asset_operation
    *  @brief Creates a new asset 
    *
    *  An asset can be used for everything from stocks, to bonds, to
    *  rewards points, tickets or even a market-issued asset.
    *
    *  Every asset is uniquely identified by a symbol name that must
    *  be at least 3 characters [A-Z].  Symbol names are in high demand
    *  so reserving them carries a fee.  The fewer the characters the
    *  higher the fee.   Symbols longer than 8 characters are charged
    *  the minimum fee.  The forumla for calculating the fee is
    *  MIN_FEE*10^(8-NUM_CHARS).
    *
    *  Other properties such as *name* and *description* are for
    *  record keeping purposes only.  A name has a maximum length of
    *  63 characters and the description field is charged a data fee.
    *
    *  Ability to issue and update an asset depend entirely upon the
    *  issuer's owner and active keys.  
    *
    *  Assets can grant their issuers many different privileges so that
    *  the issuer can comply with all necessary regulatory compliance. Any
    *  of these permissions can be permanently revoked to protect the
    *  owners of the asset.   
    *
    *  BitAssets (aka Market Issued Assets) can be created by anyone provided
    *  they specify a set of feed producers. 
    *
    *  The issuer of an asset can specify a transfer fee that will be paid to
    *  the issuer on every transfer operation for the specified asset.
    *  
    *  The issuer can also specify a market fee as a percent of the proceeds
    *  of every order denominated this asset type.  This is designed to
    *  allow exchanges to make money in the traditional maner.
